1.

Over the last decade the advent of affordable laser range finders has enabled mobile robotics to shift towards a new level of environment perception.

Ideally, a semantic understanding of the environment would allow for interpreting these directions in the correct context and derive low-level navigation actions.

3.

Before we start describing the clustering process, it is useful to formalize the problem description.

an accurate and real-time perception of the world is critical for AVs. 3D LiDARs can generate high- reso-
lution 3D point clouds of the environment while remaining unaffected by varying illumination, making them popular and widely used in the perception systems of AVs. In recent years, with the rapid development of key technologies, the price of LiDARs has dropped rapidly, making its application much more valuable.
